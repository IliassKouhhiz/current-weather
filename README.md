# Description

This is a simple React + TypeScript + Vite project.

The key aspects on which i worked on, are:

- State menagment -> I used zustand, a small, scalable and easy to use solution.
- Error handling -> I tried to cover every corner case i could think of, and implement a solid error handling strategy.
- Responsive design -> Media queries, relative units (rem, %), mobile first.
- Accessibility -> I tried to implement the most recent Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.
- Best practices -> Overall i tried to write a clean, organized and maintainable code.

### Getting started

In order to run this application, node and npm have to be installed on your machine

In the root folder run:

```
npm i
```

then

```
npm run dev
```

### Next steps

If this was a real project, the next steps will be:

- Add keyboard control on dropdown for accessibility. (I wasn't able to implement it due to lack of time)
- Add unit and integration tests
- Structure the store (state menagment) in a more complex way, in order to have a well organized code, once the amount of data to store increases.
